## 📿 About the Project

**Radha Naam Jap Counter** is a spiritually inspired web project that allows devotees to chant sacred names digitally.

Each click represents **one Jap**, with:
- visual floating-name animations  
- sound feedback (bell)  
- mobile vibration  
- automatic **Mala counting after 108 chants**

The UI is carefully designed to create a **meditative, bhakti-filled experience** using soft colors, transparency, smoke effects, and calm animations.
